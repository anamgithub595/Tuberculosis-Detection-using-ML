# Tuberculosis-Detection-using-ML
An CNN based binary classification model to classify X-Ray scans on whether they are suffering from Tuberculosis or not. 

**Data**
The data originates from a Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/tuberculosis-tb-chest-xray-dataset)

**The Model**
The model would be a CNN built through Keras and TensorFLow, the architecture of the model is left to the contributor, it uses a combination of convolution, maxpooling, dense and dropout layer to ensure maximum accuracy and efficiency. 

**Frontend**
The frontend would be made using react. It would consist of a Form like interface where one can upload an image. The image would then be send to the backend for inference and would await a response from the backend. On recieving the prediction it would display it to the user.
